#InnerSource scenarios

Where InnerSource methodology is being used? Which kind of companies are already
using it?

In 2000, Tim O'Reilly defined InnerSource as "the use of open source development 
techniques within the corporation". Clearly this definition applies to
companies developing software for their own use or to be used by 
third parties.

Some common open source development techniques are:

- transparent development: anyone is able to review and contribute

- forks are welcome: innovation is usually driven by new ideas from existing projects

- diverse teams: people from all around the world are able to contribute, independently of their gender,
  education, race, etc.

- transparent communication: everything, from documents to conversations, is written and 
  stored, to allow historical review
  
InnerSource, like open source, is well suited for cross-organization collaboration breaking
boundaries of teams, business units and nations.

Beyond the obvious profile, software development companies, let's see some 
scenarios or situations where InnerSource can help.

## The digital transformation wave

In previous years, many companies have started facing what
they call their “Digital Transformation”, to become omnichannel
companies[^1]. They become heavy IT users and the key transformation
steps usually are defined by

-   breaking cross-organizational silos (cultural change)

-   adoption new IT technologies (cloud, big data, mobile, etc.)

The adoption of these technologies usually means that companies need 
to build competent “DevOps”[^2] teams. Yes, “DevOps”, the second 
hype-word after “Digital Transformation” of these ages.

“DevOps teams” share some principles with collaborative development
teams in the open source world. As first described by John Willis and
Damon Edwards in 2010, CALMS, standing for Culture (collaboration),
Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing to describe the “DevOps
framework”, obviously contains terms familiar to any open source
developer.

These teams usually develop custom software solutions and deployment
recipes for their companies. For small, medium enterprises this
could be useful and easy to manage. But, what happens when the company
has several DevOps teams around the world? How can they ensure maximum
code/knowledge reuse across the organization?

We have seen companies facing the same problem with different solutions
due to the lack of cross-organizational transparency and collaborative
methodologies.

## The world of silos

In some cases, there is a corporate head or central unit that decides
the technology for the rest of business units. When these business units
adopt the technology, they usually need to customize it, ending with
something slightly different to the original product. While the central
unit evolves its product in their “closed silo”, the other units are
probably doing the same in their “silos”. The result? The adoption of
any update of the “core product” is a nightmare.

In other cases, business units behave as independent companies. Each one
uses their own IT architecture, ending with an inefficient management of
resources caused by multiplication of technologies, developments, etc.

Collaborative development in open source ecosystems has been used several
times as an example of how these methodologies can break silos between
companies that might even be market competitors. Those companies have
been able to share knowledge and resources with a common goal. If competitors can
collaborate to build technology their businesses rely on, why
couldn't corporate business units do the same if they have corporate
success as a mission?

## The start-ups bubble

Many people might discuss if we are living a “start-ups bubble” or not,
but we are clearly surrounded by news about how a group of few people go
from a garage to a multinational company in a few years through
investment rounds.

Our experience tell us that opening offices abroad is always a
challenge, and managing development teams growing that fast can be a
serious problem.

The lack of effective and transparent communication channels and
documented procedures might make it harder for any new employee to on-board
and to be engaged with the company.

On the other hand, recently created companies have been born taking
advantage of the existing IT solutions to provide omnichannel services.
They are used to working under “DevOps culture” and it might be easier for
them to adopt a common cross-organizational methodology that allows
transparency and collaboration.

## Disengagement at work

If previous scenarios are familiar to you, probably you don’t feel
engaged at work. Don’t worry, you are not alone. According to World
Economic Forum [^3] 70% of employees say they are disengaged at work.

In the same article, it says that “Research from the University of
California found that motivated employees were 31% more productive, had
37% higher sales, and were three times more creative than demotivated
employees. They were also 87% less likely to quit, according to a
Corporate Leadership Council study on over 50,000 people”.

Towers Watson[^4] found that companies with engaged employees produced
19.2% more operative incomes in one year, but companies with worse
engagement operative incomes get reduced by 32.7%.

It was Daniel Pink in his book "Drive"[^5] who argues that human motivation is 
largely intrinsic. The aspects of this motivation can be divided into 

- autonomy, typical for OSS projects developers that are self-managed

- mastery, as the desire to improve developer skills to improve the project they are involved in

- purpose, defined as mission in many OSS projects

These aspects are key for software developers' motivation, since their tasks
involve cognitive skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking.
