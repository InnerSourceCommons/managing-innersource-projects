Goals using Metrics
===================

This section aims at providing a strategy for your InnerSource metrics
that help to understand the path from your initial process till a full
InnerSource organization.

It is important to remark that metrics useful for some organizations are
not that useful in other contexts. This is similar to the open source
projects where a project is not that similar to other in terms of
governance, licenses, infrastructure or detailed process, but they are
producing open source software and working as a community. This handbook
has a similar goal, to detail how an ideal InnerSource project would
be, but there are not two organizations using the same InnerSource
approach.

Thus, metrics useful for some contexts, for example technological
organizations, might not apply to other context such as banks due to
external factors such as legal regulations that are even different from
country to country.

In addition to all of this, when measuring InnerSource, there are three
main purposes to use metrics: check on going work, lead process
improvement[^5] and motivational aspects.

-   **Check** on going work: this helps to understand where the
    development is right now. To be aware of the status helps to
    understand how fast things are changing when a new process is in the
    pipeline. This also helps to go from A to B and even trying several
    approaches to the same problem and have tests for this.

-   **Lead** process improvement: InnerSource means a change in how
    process works in the following. From a hierarchical way to a flatter
    way of working, InnerSource needs indicators to help to determine
    if that process improvement is properly working. And if this is not
    working, then using another approach or apply other policies.

-   **Motivational** aspects: InnerSource also means cultural change,
    and this is not usually taken into account in other methodologies.
    Indeed, this cultural change is identified in InnerSource as key.
    This should be the type of actions that will help to migrate from a
    traditional way of working to a more transparent and community-
    oriented way to work. And metrics can help to lead this process.
    First, to let developers know where they are and how their process
    is working, but also to have some fun within the work and
    competitions through challenges, hackathons and other measurable
    activities that lead to a more community-oriented organizations.
