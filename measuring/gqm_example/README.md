## How Do I Add New Goals, Questions, and Metrics?

Each goal, question, and metric is defined in its own markdown file. The goals, questions, and metrics are used to:

1. Define clear objectives for InnerSource initiatives
2. Guide the selection of relevant questions
3. Help determine appropriate metrics for measurement

## Adding New Goals, Questions, and Metrics

To add a new goal, question, or metric:
1. Create a new markdown file in the `goals`, `questions`, or `metrics` directory
2. Update the GQM diagram by running the generator in the /scripts/gqm_gen directory

# How Should I Format Goals Questions & Metrics?

* [gqm_goal_template.md](../goals/gqm_goal_template.md)
* [gqm_question_template.md](../questions/gqm_question_template.md)
* [gqm_metric_template.md](../metrics/gqm_metric_template.md)

# How Do I Add A Goal Question Metric (GQM)?

See the ["Metrics" section of CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#metrics).

# What Is The Goal Question Metric (GQM) Example?

The GQM example is a starting point to create additional Goals, Questions, and Metrics relevant to an InnerSource Program Office (ISPO).
